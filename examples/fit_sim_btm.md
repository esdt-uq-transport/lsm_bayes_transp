## Fit and Simulate from Transport Map 

This example describes implementation of Bayesian transport maps (BTM) for ensembles of snow water equivalent (SWE). 
Before executing the BTM fitting scripts below, the ensemble data must be downloaded and location-specific quantiles computed 
for the target date of interest as described in the [preprocessing example](swe_ens_process.md)

* Train BTM from contemporary climate SWE ensemble and simulate from fitted model: `lens_h2osno_trsnf_batram_20c_wrr.py`
* Train BTM from RCP8.5 scenario SWE ensemble and simulate from fitted model: `lens_h2osno_trsnf_batram_rcp_wrr.py`
