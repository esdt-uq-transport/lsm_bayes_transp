### Examples

Additional examples illustrating Bayesian transport maps for land surface model ensembles. 
The documentation in this directory provides an overview of the processing steps and relevant python scripts for their execution. 
The scripts can be found in the repository `script` directory. Supporting routines are available in `lib` and supporting metadata are in `config`.
